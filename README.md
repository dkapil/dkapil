### Dhawal Kapil (not a 10x Developer)
----
#### Hi/Hello/Namastey ðŸ‘‹

I am Dhawal (he/his) - working as a Software Developer. I build products in Java and Spring stack and the related technologies.
I try to contribute to Open Source projects and I am trying to give more and more time to these projects in future.

I believe in Clean Code, Refactoring, Testing and related methodologies that makes code sustainable and maintainable.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Working on a new Spring OAuth2 Course in collaboration with [Baeldung](https://courses.baeldung.com/)
- ðŸŒ± Learning more and more about Micro Services and how they work
